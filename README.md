## Hi, boozhoo

I'm Kyle and I'm a recent Master's graduate looking for work as a developer in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I attended the University of British Columbia - and Brandon University before that - where I studied mathematics and computer science.

I wouldn't say I love coding - I love my parents, my sister and niece - but I really enjoy the process of problem solving! While the experience can be frustrating at time, the journey to a fully realized project has its own rewards - there's always to problems to solve!

I'm currently expanding and building my knowledge of web related languages, tools, and frameworks.
