## Hi, boozhoo


I'm Kyle - a software engineer located in Vancouver, Canada. 
Currently I'm an engineer working within the Amazon Payment Products organization, supporting US PLCC servicing and US CBCC acquisitions. 

During my free time I'm usually working on personal software projects or spending time with my new duck toller puppy 🐕‍🦺
